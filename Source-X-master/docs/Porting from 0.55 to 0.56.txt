Lots of scripts got updated or reorganized (sphere_serv_Triggers.scp, stones/* all files and folders,
 sphere_skills/spells...)

55r2:
  - FixAction functions are no longer needed.
  - added INTERRUPT to spells file. (Script Pack)

55r3:
  - Changed TRY to make no plevel or touch/distance checks. Use TRYP if you want those checks (TRYP 0 only checks for touch/distance, not plevel).
  - Added RANGE=min,max or RANGE=max (min defaults to 0) for ITEMDEF and CHARDEF. (Script Pack)
  - Changed [AREA to [AREADEF, same for rooms.
  - Added spheredata.scp to the Save/ folder, create it empty and your vars, regions/sectors/room changes, and some more global things will be stored there in your future saves.

55r3rc2
  - Added DEFMESSAGE (look for sphere_msgs.scp and add it).
  - Changed SPELLFLAG_TARG_* in spells. (Script Pack: sphere_spells and sphere_defs for the flags)
  - When loading a world with VERSION below "0.55 R3", convert spells that affect stats, by
      removing its effect from base stats (old method) then putting the effect into modstats
      (new method). This ensures compatibility with spells and cursed items.
      Notice that this only works for worlds saved on versions earlier than R3, seeing as worlds
      saved on the test versions of R3 made no conversion and thus had items with both formats
      which cannot be distinguished.
      If for some reason you want to bypass this conversion on an old world, change the version
      of the save files to "0.55 R3". If you want to force this conversion on a world saved with
      R3 test versions, change its version to "0.55".

55r403
  - Added spherestatics.scp, same as spheredata but for attr_static items. So they are not being saved in each worldsave, hence saving time. To save them use serv.servstatics
  - Code cleanups, removed some useless (not enabled keywords), same keywords grouped
      to one variant for usage for faster work lookups:
      1. *WEIGHT[MAX]->*[MAX]WEIGHT, BRAIN->NPC, KNOWLEDGE->SPEECH, COMMENT->TAG.COMMENT
      CLI*VER*->CLIENTVERSION, DEF->ARMOR, LISTEN->HEARALL, *PRICE->PRICE, VER->VERSION
      WEBPAGEDST->WEPAGEFILE (LoadKeys)
      2. CLIENTS->ALLCLIENTS, PARDON->FORGIVE, INVISIBLE->INVIS, INVULNERABLE->INVUL,
      R->RUN, W->WALK, CLIENTS->ADMIN, MIDI/MUSIC->MIDILIST, [RE]SYNC->RESEND, ADDITEM->ADD
      FOLLOWED->FOLLOW, M->MOVE, PROPS/TWEAK->INFO, SPEAK[U[A]]->SAY[U[A]], SFX->SOUND
      SAFE->SECURE (VerbKeys)
  - Removed ADDNPC since it is already integrated with ADD command for both items and npc (You should have sphere_backwards.scp for compat with old functions/defs).
