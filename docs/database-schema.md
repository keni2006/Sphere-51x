# MySQL Schema Overview

This project relies on a small number of MySQL tables that back account
management and optional world state persistence. The following summary reflects
schema version 3 as created by the migrations in
`GraySvr/CWorldStorageMySQL.cpp`.

## `schema_version`
Stores the current schema revision as well as the flag that indicates whether
a legacy import has been completed.

| version | INT         | Current version/flag value.           |

Primary record for player accounts.

## `sectors`, `gm_pages`, `servers`, `timers`
Supporting tables for optional features mirrored from the legacy schema. The
important column types are kept unsigned for identifiers/counters and respect
the foreign keys laid out in the migrations.

## World persistence tables (`schema` version â‰¥ 3)
The following tables power MySQL backed world persistence.

### `world_objects`
Metadata for each object that appears in the world save.

| Column         | Type                | Notes |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| uid            | BIGINT UNSIGNED     | Primary key matching the Sphere UID. |
| object_type    | VARCHAR(32)         | Either `char` or `item`. |
| object_subtype | VARCHAR(64)         | Hex-encoded base ID. |
| name           | VARCHAR(128)        | Optional display name. |

*Indexes*: keys on `object_type`, `account_id`, `container_uid`, and
`top_level_uid` assist lookups for synchronization flows. Foreign keys keep the
tree consistent and default to `SET NULL` for soft-orphan handling.

`component` to speed component fetches.

| relation   | VARCHAR(32)     | Relation name (`equipped`, `container`). |
| sequence   | INT             | Ordering for siblings. |

Composite primary key `(parent_uid, child_uid, relation, sequence)` with a
secondary index on `child_uid` and cascading deletes on both foreign keys.

| object_uid | BIGINT UNSIGNED     | FK to `world_objects.uid`. |
| changed_at | DATETIME            | Timestamp of the change. |
| change_type| VARCHAR(32)         | Type/category of modification. |
| data_before| LONGTEXT            | Optional previous serialized state. |
| data_after | LONGTEXT            | Optional new serialized state. |

Indexes exist on `object_uid` to accelerate history lookups.
