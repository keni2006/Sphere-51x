4/28/2000 - Sphere 51b
LIGHTDAY to SPHERE.INI
Underground flag for regions should turn off weather. Still is a new client bug with waether in dungeons though.
?TEST - Vendors release too fast, even if paid way ahead
FIX - not criminal to heal yourself if you are evil.

use ARMOR instead of DEF for SChar armor base.
Get rid of MANA= and HITS= from CHAR.SCP. no need to set these.
HIREDAYWAGE= must come after NPC=

September 3, 1999 Revision Notes:
As of this release all default vendors have been tested and none are selling unpriced or inappropriate items like rocks.  We are still getting reports of rocks in loot and have narrowed the problem down to magical random items. We're going to be changing how magical items are generated, so look for more notes later.  Please report any bugs at www.menasoft.com/tus


*ITEMS:
Growing Reagents, Contributed by Aphrodite! Thanks!
Added Growing Reagents to the items file (they're triggers, but see the items file.) You can grow and harvest these reagents -- and they may be used as reagents.  These properties were added to the default "growing" items themselves so if you have other triggers or purposes for these items, make sure that you're only making your changes to the tusitems2.scp file or your original work may not function properly.

//choose a Race.
